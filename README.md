Today's challenge is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge using Artificial Intelligence. However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices. The project [Machine Learning @ the Extreme Edge](https://mlate2dge.github.io/) examines how to apply embedded machine learning to develop accurate, energy-efficient models for intelligent devices.

# Embedded Machine Learning Pipeline

The Embedded Machine Learning Pipeline is shown below. During the project's timeframe, retraining was performed using Edge Impulse Studio. It is recommended for future implementations to use the Profiling and Deploy from [Edge Impulse Python SDK](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tools/overview) combined with [Weights & Biases](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/integrations/weights-and-biases). Some Python scripts, as starting point for the integration, can be found in `./ei/profiling-deploy`.

# Environment Setup

**Prerequisite:** 
- [Edge Impulse Studio](https://edgeimpulse.com/)
- [Weights & Biases platform](https://wandb.ai/)

**Recommended:**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<br>The developement is done using the Ubuntu OS (Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS). Create the environment using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html): 

```
$ conda env create -f conda.yaml
```
