Today's trend is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge using Artificial Intelligence. However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. The challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices. The project [🔗 Machine Learning @ the Extreme Edge](https://mlate2dge.github.io/) examines how to apply embedded machine learning to develop accurate, energy-efficient models for intelligent devices.

**✏️ Note.** During the project's timeframe, retraining was performed using Edge Impulse Studio. In future implementations it is recommended to use the Edge Impulse Profiling and Deploy [🔗 Edge Impulse Python SDK](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tools/overview) (released April 4 2023 [Unveiling BYOM and the Edge Impulse Python SDK](https://edgeimpulse.com/blog/unveiling-the-new-edge-impulse-python-sdk)) combined with [🔗 Weights & Biases](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/integrations/weights-and-biases) AI developer platform. Some Python scripts can be found in [🔗 `./ei/profiling-deploy`](https://github.com/MLatE2dge/mlate2dge/tree/main/ei/profiling-deploy). These scripts can be used as a starting point for the integration into the embedded machine learning pipeline.
