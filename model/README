# Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge

## TensorFlow Lite model

### Best Practice. 

Model files should **NOT** be saved on GitHub but in, for example, [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/models) model registry.  However, we added to models to GitHub and provided "AS IS" for your information. We recommend to use [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) to view the neural network model architecture.
